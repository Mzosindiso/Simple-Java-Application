# Bank Account Management System

## Project Overview

This Java application is a simple Bank Account Management System designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming principles and basic banking operations. It's developed as part of a learning exercise for Java programming and software design concepts.

## Purpose

The main purposes of this project are:

1. To practice implementing a real-world system using Java.
2. To demonstrate the use of classes, inheritance, and exception handling in Java.
3. To simulate basic banking operations such as managing customers, accounts, and loans.
